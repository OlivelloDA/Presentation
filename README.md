# About me

Hi there! It's Claudio! I am currently working as Quant Analyst at OpenGamma, a derivative analytics firm based in London.


I am specialised in designing, implementing, validating and testing margin models for ETD and OTC financial products. 


Previously, I've worked at the AI/Analytics team of AXA Belgium where we designed and implemented ML models
to predict severity damages of car accidents and the likelihood for a claim to result in a total loss.
